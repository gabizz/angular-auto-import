# angular-auto-import BETA - Atom Package

Angular auto-import automatically imports existing classes (as long as they exist in your Atom's current working directory) in your Angular files.

To use it, add the class in the constructor arguments, select it (just the name) and press `CTRL` + `ALT` + `i`. The class will be automatically imported in the top of your actual Angular component, service, etc. behind your first import line.
